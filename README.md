  Deployed Application: https://cold-tea.herokuapp.com/

  ## Description

  This text editor application was built by implementing methods for getting and storing data using the IndexedDB database. The idb package, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API, was utilized to facilitate data retrieval and storage. With these features in place, users can create and edit text content, and their changes will be reliably saved using IndexedDB.
